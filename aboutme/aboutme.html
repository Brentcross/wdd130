    <h2>Brent Cross</h2>
    <h2>My old nickname was "B-man"</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone! My name is Brent Cross. I currently am a full-time student at BYU-Idaho while living in my home here in Nampa Idaho. 
    <p>I am majoring in computer information technology with a minor in Spanish, with an end goal of becoming a backend developer for my current company, Costco Wholesale.</p>
    <p>I have been a baker for them since 2016 and look forward to working with them in fixing their website and hopefully improving their eCommerce page. I love going hunting, fishing, and riding my motorcycle in the summer when it isn't 10 degrees outside. This last year I found out I had cancer and have been going through that alongside my loving wife. </p>
