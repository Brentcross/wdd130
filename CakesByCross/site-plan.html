      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/7baacc-ef8b6c-dd8585-381d2a" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/7baacc-ef8b6c-dd8585-381d2a</a>

      I think I have chosen these two fonts because first of the boldness comes through and 
      also the Caveat is going to be a very nice and gives the bakery feel.

      <h3>Who are the Cross’? </h3>
      <p>
        [Hi! We are the Cross family, Jessica and Brent! Both of us grew up with a love for baking! From our parents running bakeries to just simply making and selling cookies out of their houses. We have always been surrounded by bakers of all types! Our business has started out of a small apartment in Meridian Idaho, and now we do all of our work out of the home that we purchased last year. It has been an amazing adventure 
        Jessica grew up in Las Vegas where her mother taught her the best ways to make cookies including sugar and chocolate chip! He has a great knack and eye for detail. As the one who always bakes the cakes, Jessica has a way of making all the cakes soft and moist. 
        Brent grew up in Washington State where his father ran Winchell’s donuts. Brent watched his father make thousands of donuts during his childhood. He has always been interested in baking and currently is a baker for Costco Wholesale. One day Brent wanted to make a special cake for a birthday party for his nephew, this sparked an idea to create a business where they could make wedding cakes and other treats for special occasions.

      <h3>Questions to be answered on this site!</h3>
      <p>
        [We know many of you will have questions about cakes and our process. This page will hopefully answer all of those questions. If by chance they don’t, please feel free to reach out to us privately through our contact information provided and we will answer those questions just as soon as we can! 
        How much do cakes cost?
          Cakes vary in price based on size and details wanted on them. We feel we are very fair on our prices and do our best to keep your budget. Once we get your information and what you would like your cake to be, we will set a price and work from there!
        Can you ship cakes?
          Unfortunately, we are unable to ship cakes at this time. We are willing and able to send other treats such as truffles and macaroons, but we haven’t found a good method of transporting your special cake! 
        Do you do gluten-free/special allergen cakes?
          We do offer a few different types of cakes. We may not be able to accommodate all types of allergies, due to the fact is we want to keep our quality based on our secret recipes. If we are able to accommodate your special allergies there will be no special charge for that.
