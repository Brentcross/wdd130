                <p>Unfortunately, we are unable to ship cakes at this time. We are willing and able to send other treats such as truffles and macaroons, but we havenâ€™t found a good method of transporting your special cake!</p>

                <h3>Do you do gluten-free/special allergen cakes?</h3>
                <p>We do offer a few different types of cakes. We may not be able to accommodate all types of allergies, due to the fact is we want to keep our quality based on our secret recipes. If we are able to accommodate your special allergies there will be no special charge for that.</p>
