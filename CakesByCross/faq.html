		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

		<h3>How much do cakes cost?</h3>
		<p>Cakes vary in price based on size and details wanted on them. We feel we are very fair on our prices and do our best to keep your budget. Once we get your information and what you would like your cake to be, we will set a price and work from there!
</p>

		<h3>Can you ship cakes?</h3>
		<p>Unfortunately, we are unable to ship cakes at this time. We are willing and able to send other treats such as truffles and macaroons, but we havenâ€™t found a good method of transporting your special cake!</p>
	
		<h3>Do you do gluten-free/special allergen cakes?</h3>
		<p>We do offer a few different types of cakes. We may not be able to accommodate all types of allergies, due to the fact is we want to keep our quality based on our secret recipes. If we are able to accommodate your special allergies there will be no special charge for that.</p>
	
		<h3>What forms of payment do you accept?</h3>
		<p>We accept cash, check, and credit card payments.</p>
