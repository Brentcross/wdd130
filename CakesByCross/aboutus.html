			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>Meet the bakers behind Cakes-By-Cross</p>
            <p>Hi! We are the Cross family, Jessica and Brent! Both of us grew up with a love for baking! From our parents running bakeries to just simply making and selling cookies out of their houses. 
                We have always been surrounded by bakers of all types! 
                Our business has started out of a small apartment in Meridian Idaho,
                 and now we do all of our work out of the home that we purchased last year. It has been an amazing adventure </p>

				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>Brent grew up in Washington State where his father ran Winchells donuts. 
                    Brent watched his father make thousands of donuts during his childhood. 
                    He has always been interested in baking and currently is a baker for Costco Wholesale. One day Brent wanted to make a special cake for a birthday party for his nephew, this sparked an idea to create a business where they could make wedding cakes and other treats for special occasions. </p>

				<h3>About My Wife</h3>
				<p>Jessica grew up in Las Vegas where her mother taught her the best ways to make cookies including sugar and chocolate chip!
                     She has a great knack and eye for detail. 
                     As the one who always bakes the cakes, Jessica has a way of making all the cakes soft and moist. </p>
